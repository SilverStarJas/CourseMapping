# CourseMapping
Course mapping between universities.
This is an application used for students wanting to transfer or do an exchange, allowing them to find the units they have already done or still have to complete, and their equivalents in the university they are moving to.

**TODO:**
- Fix GET specific course and subject
- Fix controller to call update methods from Domain object (with nullable fields)
- Return response object instead of domain for endpoints
- Retrieve Course and Subject through University - not necessary to have extra methods just for retrieving Course and Subject
- Install EF Core CLI and migrate to Sqlite - format and rename tables/columns to follow convention
